Skinware: The Skin Middle-ware
==============================

    0. Overview
    -----------

Skinware in its core provides a flexible data chunk transfer mechanism between
two tasks, as is suitable for a skin-related application.  Generic services
can be provided and used by starting writers and readers. Skin-tailored drivers
and users internally use writers and readers, but provide facilities over them
useful for a skin application.

    1. Prerequisites
    ----------------

First and foremost, you need to have URT installed:

    https://github.com/ShabbyX/URT

URT provides the real-time abstraction layer.  If use use RTAI as the real-time
back-end, make sure to read README.RTAI.

If you are building from source, you would need `autoconf-archive` to properly
generate the `configure` script.

On a Debian-based distribution, the following would do:

    $ apt install autoconf-archive

To compile Skinware, you need the following compilers:

- gcc: for compiling the skin library, the tools and the calibrator,
- g++: for compiling the C++ library, and various apps.

There are a few graphical libraries needed by the visualizer, but as of the
current version, they are my own simple libraries and I have included them
with Skinware.  You will need the following additional libraries:

- SDL   : Simple DirectMedia Library (for window handling) (v1.2)
- OpenGL: Graphical rendering (higher than v1.2)
- GLU   : OpenGL utilities library

On a Debian-based distribution, the following would do:

    $ apt install libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libsdl1.2-dev

To build the documentation files, you need DocThis!

- DocThis!: https://github.com/ShabbyX/DocThis

(Let us cleanse this world of the horror that is doxygen!)

To build the documentation in pdf, the following software is also needed:

- pdflatex: To compile LaTeX files
